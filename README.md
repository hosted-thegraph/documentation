## FAQ

1. What is the difference between the TheGraph decentralized network and our service?
> The Graph network is a decentralized graphql that runs on Ethereum.
> Our service is a hosted solution, where customers have to trust that we are serving them right data.
> But in return they get unmatched speed and great developer experience.
> Once project running on our hosted solution, grows to a stage where decentralize graph is required, we can help them migrate the main subgraph to decentralized network.
> For testing and development, they still use our hosted solution to reduced costs and increase developer velocity.
2. Why a project would want to use our hosted TheGraph service?
> - Better speed than public free version.
> - Direct integration with IPFS (very reliable with access inside subgraph mappings).
> - Easier development through multiple environments.
> - Customer focuses only on their contracts and data that they want.
>   For the rest, we take care of it (hosting, indexing, speed, multiple networks etc...).
